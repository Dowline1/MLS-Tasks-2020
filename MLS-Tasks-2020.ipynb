    "### Question 1\n",
    "Calculating the Square Root of 2 to 100 decimal places\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial code to calculate square root adapted from (perigon, 2017), in the link it is discussed that calculating square root can be done by raising the number to perform square root on by a power of 0.5. This has given me the start of a function to calculate the square root of 2 however further work is needed to increase decimals to 100 places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further research brought me to a Stack Overflow discussion (SYK, 2015) that used format to increase the precision of a floating number which I have adapted and used to display 100 decimal places. The only issue is what looks like after around 50/60 places I am getting recurring 0's which is obviously not correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "After additional investigation in the Python Documentation (Python Software Foundation, 2020), it appears that there is a limitation as to what precision of numbers can be stored on computers when mapping python floats when it comes to arithmetic. Python floats are mapped to IEEE-754 “double precision” which contain 53 bits of precision which aligns with the number of decimals I am currently displaying."
