    "**Calculating the Square Root of 2 to 100 decimal places**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial code to calculate square root adapted from (perigon, 2017), in the link it is discussed that calculating square root can be done by raising the number to perform square root on by a power of 0.5. This has given me the start of a function to calculate the square root of 2 however further work is needed to increase decimals to 100 places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further research brought me to a Stack Overflow discussion (SYK, 2015) that used format to increase the precision of a floating number which I have adapted and used to display 100 decimal places. The only issue is what looks like after around 50/60 places I am getting recurring 0's which is obviously not correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "After additional investigation in the Python Documentation (Python Software Foundation, 2020), it appears that there is a limitation as to what precision of numbers can be stored on computers when mapping python floats when it comes to arithmetic. Python floats are mapped to IEEE-754 “double precision” which contain 53 bits of precision which aligns with the number of decimals I am currently displaying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further reading in the python documentation revealed integers can be much longer that floats so I am trying to leverage that fact by converting the square root of 2 to an integer ratio and multiplying this up to give an int of required length to convert back to a decimal (Python Software Foundation, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "After further check it looks like the calculation however is not giving the correct answer to the square root of 2, this falls back to the same issue as original calculation is done using floats (Python Software Foundation, 2020) which are limited in their precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional research online brought me to a website describing calculating standard deviation of an integer which I will be using to calculate square root of $2x10^{200}$ (to allow for required length of decimals) code adapted using (D'Aprano, 2011). This algorithm was come accross by reading on Wikipedia into integer square root so that I could take advantage of large number of charaters stored as integers (Wikipedia, 2020)."

For example if a researcher recruited several males aged between 45 and 60 years old to study genetic markers for a particular disease they would use STDEV.S.
