Repository for Machine Learning &amp; Statistics Module for Assessment Tasks 2020

## Running the Jupyter Notebook
1. Click this [link](https://github.com/Dowline1/MLS-Tasks-2020) for my Github repository.
2. Click the download button to save a copy of the repository on your machine.
3. Make sure you have Python installed including Jupyter, if you require installation please follow instructions in this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to download Python via Anaconda.
4. Use your command line such as CMDER to navigate to the folder housing the Git repository, download for CMDER found via this [link](https://cmder.net/).
5. Once in the folder type the command "Jupyter Notebook" and click enter.
6. This will open a Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser, click on the file "MLS-Tasks-2020.ipynb".
7. Once in the Jupyter Notebook itself click on Kernel then Restart And Run All as per **image below**, this will run the code and generate all graphs.

All references, data and commentary relating to project can be found within the Jupyter Notebook, please refer here for my submission.

## Introduction
### Square Root of 2
Most of the calculations that we are used to using in mathematics have an opposite or inverse to the calculation, for example subtraction is the opposite of addition division is the opposite to multiplication and so on. The same can be said for powers or exponents of numbers with the inverse of exponents being square roots  (Math.com, n.d.).

Simply explained the square root of a number n is the number that when multiplied by itself is equal to n some of which are perfect squares and do not require any decimal places. The $\sqrt{100}$ is equal to 10 as 10 x 10 or $10^2$ equals 100 and is a perfect square, whereas the $\sqrt{30}$ is equal to roughly 5.4772 and so it not a perfect square as it's square root is not a whole number.

###  Chi-squared test
The Chi Square Test has two distinct types which both use the chi-square statistic and distribution in there calculation (Glen, 2020). 

The first is a chi-square goodness of fit test and is used to determine if a sample of data matches up with the population. The second is a chi-square test for independence which compares two variables or categories using a contingency table in order to determine if the categories are related.

For this aspect of the Tasks Assignment the goal is to verify that the chi-square value of the example used in (Wikipedia Contributors, 2020) relating to a neighborhood and the distribution of the residents working class equates to 24.6 using scipy.stats.

### Standard Deviation
The Standard Deviation is a measure of how far apart numbers are in a dataset denoted by the symbol Ïƒ or sigma. Standard Deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the **variance** with variance being calculated by taking each value in the set, subtracting this from the overall average as the **difference** and finally squaring this difference and finding the average of all these differences giving you the variance (Math is Fun, 2017).
